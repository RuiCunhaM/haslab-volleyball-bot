# HASLab Volleyball Bot

A custom Mattermost slash command used at HASLab to help schedule Volleyball games. Triggered from within a channel, it scrapes the court availability and creates a [Rallly](https://rallly.co/) poll so everyone can vote.

Built with Python and [Digital Ocean Functions](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/functions).
